# CS375 Final Project

In my free time, I love making digital art. My style takes advantage of many computer graphics techniques such as blend modes, threshold, noise generation, dithering, displacement, etc. For this project, I want to take it a step further and introduce animation. If I have extra time, I might even include some interactive elements.

I plan on using ThreeJS for its ease of use and expansive set of capabilities. 

Some examples of some of my artwork can be found on [my portfolio website](https://emtacolor.com).

Rough Schedule:<br>
Week 1 - Figure out dev environment and learn the basics of ThreeJS<br>
Week 2 - Work on layout/general look of the scene<br>
Week 3 - Animation<br>
Week 4 - Polishing, maybe adding some interactive elements<br>
